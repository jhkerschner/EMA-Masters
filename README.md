# EMA-Masters

If you are going to want to test out the functionality at all, you will need to run MAMP, so the site can communicate with firebase.

<strong>index.html</strong> - This is the main file, this is where you will add your CSS link. All of the other files (leaderboard.html, player.html, round-complete.html, and scorecard.html) are loaded in to this page in the "ng-view" div, via routing. 

<strong>player.html</strong> - This is the first view you will see as a player, they will enter their name here.

<strong>scorecard.html</strong> - This view is used to enter strokes for each hole. Users will see this 18 times (for 18 holes).

<strong>round-complete.html</strong> - This view just lets the user know they are done, and shows their total score.

<strong>leaderboard.html</strong> - This view is the leaderboard. It automatically updates based on score. Depending on time, I might add more functionality to this to show over and under par.
